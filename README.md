# ghg_emissions

This repository contains the scripts and data for analyzing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions trends and creating visualizations. The analysis focuses on three specific aspects: GHG growth over time, per capita emissions grouped by income level, and contributions by continents and countries to global emissions.

Repository Files
Scripts

ghg_emissions_T1.py: Code for analyzing the evolution of GHG emissions in the euro area, EU27, and worldwide.
ghg_per_capita_T2.py: Code for calculating and visualizing GHG emissions per capita grouped by World Bank income classifications.
ghg_per_continent_T3.py: Code for visualizing the contributions of countries and continents to total global emissions.
Data Files

ghg_per_capita.csv: Dataset containing GHG emissions data per capita for various countries.
ghg_totals.csv: Dataset with total GHG emissions for euro area, EU27, and worldwide.
ghg_with_income.csv: Dataset combining GHG emissions with World Bank income group classifications.
ghg_with_income_and_continent.csv: Extended dataset with GHG emissions, income group classifications, and continent information.
Purpose
The repository is designed to:

Track and visualize the evolution of GHG emissions globally and regionally.
Compare GHG emissions per capita based on income groups.
Highlight contributions of individual countries and continents to global GHG emissions.
This structure enables efficient analysis and insight generation from EDGAR GHG emissions data.
