# GHG Emissions Analysis

## Description
This repository contains the scripts and data for analyzing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions trends and creating visualizations. The analysis focuses on three specific aspects: GHG growth over time, per capita emissions grouped by income level, and contributions by continents and countries to global emissions.

## Repository Files

### Scripts
- **`ghg_emissions_T1.py`**: Code for analyzing the evolution of GHG emissions in the euro area, EU27, and worldwide.
- **`ghg_per_capita_T2.py`**: Code for calculating and visualizing GHG emissions per capita grouped by World Bank income classifications.
- **`ghg_per_continent_T3.py`**: Code for visualizing the contributions of countries and continents to total global emissions.

### Data Files
- **`ghg_per_capita.csv`**: Dataset containing GHG emissions data per capita for various countries.
- **`ghg_totals.csv`**: Dataset with total GHG emissions for euro area, EU27, and worldwide.
- **`ghg_with_income.csv`**: Dataset combining GHG emissions with World Bank income group classifications.
- **`ghg_with_income_and_continent.csv`**: Extended dataset with GHG emissions, income group classifications, and continent information.

## Purpose
This repository is designed to:
- Track and visualize the evolution of GHG emissions globally and regionally.
- Compare GHG emissions per capita based on income groups.
- Highlight contributions of individual countries and continents to global GHG emissions.

## Usage
1. Ensure all required data files are in the same directory as the scripts.
2. Run the respective Python scripts to generate analyses and visualizations:
   - `ghg_emissions_T1.py` for Chart 1 (GHG growth evolution).
   - `ghg_per_capita_T2.py` for Chart 2 (GHG per capita by income group).
   - `ghg_per_continent_T3.py` for Chart 3 (GHG contributions by continents and countries).
3. Review the outputs and insights from the generated charts.

## Requirements
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
